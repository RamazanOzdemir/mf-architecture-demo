# MF Architecture Demo

> 🧩 A simple microfrontend architecture demo built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Webpack 5**, and **Module Federation**.

This project shows how to use Microfrontend architecture by splitting a frontend into small, independent React apps that work together.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- ⚛️ **React** – for building UI
- 🟦 **TypeScript** – for type-safe development
- 📦 **Webpack 5** – for module bundling
- 🔗 **Module Federation** – for sharing code between apps
- 💨 **Tailwind CSS** – for fast, utility-based styling
- 🧱 **shadcn/ui** or **Ant Design** – for reusable UI components (TBD)

├── user-app/       # Example microfrontend (user module)
├── product-app/    # Another microfrontend (product module)


```

## 🚀 Getting Started

This README will be updated step by step during development.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramazanozdemir/mf-architecture-demo.git
cd mf-architecture-demo/
```

### 📌 Goals

- Learn and practice Microfrontend architecture.

- Use Webpack Module Federation to connect multiple React apps.

- Build a dashboard-like project that loads features from independent apps.
